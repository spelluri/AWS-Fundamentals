✅ What is AWS EC2?

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service in AWS that allows you to launch virtual servers (called instances) in the cloud.

Think of EC2 as renting a computer in AWS’s data center.
You can choose the CPU, RAM, storage, OS (Linux/Windows), network speed, and configure it however you want.

AWS calls this “Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)”.
