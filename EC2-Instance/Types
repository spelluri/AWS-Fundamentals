✅ Different Types of EC2 Instances

EC2 instances are grouped into families, each targeting a specific workload.

Here are the main categories:

1️⃣ General Purpose Instances

Balanced CPU + RAM.

Examples:

t2, t3, t4g → burstable

m4, m5, m6i, m7g

Use cases:

Web servers

Dev/test environments

Small databases

2️⃣ Compute Optimized Instances

High CPU power.

Examples:

c4, c5, c6i, c7g

Use cases:

High-performance computing

Gaming servers

Media encoding

Machine learning inference

3️⃣ Memory Optimized Instances

Lots of RAM.

Examples:

r5, r6i, r7g

x1, x2

u- series (very high memory)

Use cases:

Large databases

In-memory caching (Redis, Memcached)

Real-time big data processing

4️⃣ Storage Optimized Instances

Optimized for very fast storage I/O.

Examples:

i3, i4i

d2, d3

Use cases:

NoSQL databases

File servers

Data warehouses

5️⃣ GPU / Accelerated Computing Instances

Used for graphics and AI.

Examples:

p3, p4 → GPU for ML training

g4, g5 → graphics, gaming, ML inference

inf1, trn1 → AWS Inferentia/Trainium chips

Use cases:

Machine learning training

GPU-intensive rendering

High-performance computing

6️⃣ Arm-based (Graviton) Instances

AWS custom ARM chips → super fast + cheaper.

Examples:

t4g, m6g, c6g, r6g

Use cases:

Cost-effective web/app servers
