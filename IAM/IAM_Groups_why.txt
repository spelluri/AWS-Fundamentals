1. What is the need of AWS Groups when you can create an IAM User and assign policies to the iam user?

The Problem Without Groups
Imagine you have 20 developers in your company. If you assign policies directly to each user:

You need to attach the same 3-4 policies to all 20 developers individually
When you hire developer #21, you need to remember which policies to attach
When you need to add a new permission (like access to a new S3 bucket), you have to update all 20 users one by one
When someone switches from developer to DevOps, you need to manually remove old policies and add new ones
If you want to see who has what access, you need to check each user individually

This gets messy fast. It's like managing permissions in a spreadsheet - totally doable for 5 people, a nightmare for 50.

How Groups Solve This
Groups let you manage permissions by role or job function instead of by individual person. Here's how it works:
You create groups like:

Developers
DevOps-Engineers
Data-Scientists
Finance-Team
Managers

Then you attach the relevant policies to each group once. After that, you just add users to the appropriate groups.
