In AWS IAM, a Group is:

👉 A collection of IAM users who share the same set of permissions (authorization policies).

How it works:

You create a group (e.g., DevOps-Team, Developers, Admins).

You attach IAM policies to the group.

Every user added to that group automatically inherits the permissions from those policies.

Example:

If you have a group called Developers with:

AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess

AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess

Any user you add to this group will automatically get read-only access to S3 and EC2.

Good to remember:

Groups cannot be nested (no group inside another group).

Groups only contain users, not roles.

A user can belong to multiple groups.

If you want, I can help you draw a simple diagram or explain roles vs groups too.
