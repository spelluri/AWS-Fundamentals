1. What happens when you created a group and added new policies to the group , will those new policies get assigned to all the users in the group automatically and immediatly?

Yes — the new policies will apply to all users in that group immediately. ✅

How it works:

IAM Groups work like “permission bundles.”

When you attach a new policy to a group, every user who is a member of that group instantly inherits the new permissions.

There is no delay, no manual refresh, and users do not need to log out and log in again.

Example:

You have a group Developers with 5 users.

You attach a new policy: AmazonRDSReadOnlyAccess.

All 5 users now have RDS read-only permissions immediately.

When might you not see changes?

Only in these rare cases:

If the user also has explicitly denied permissions elsewhere (Deny always overrides Allow).

If you’re checking using a service that caches authorization decisions (very rare).

Otherwise, IAM policy evaluation is immediate.

If you want, I can also explain:

What happens if you remove a policy from a group

Or how explicit deny works in IAM.
