# AWS-Fundamentals
Welcome to my AWS Fundamentals repository! This repo is my structured learning space where I document everything I learn about Amazon Web Services (AWS) — concepts, hands-on labs, best practices, and architecture notes.  Whether you're a beginner exploring AWS or preparing for certification, this repository aims to be a clear, practical reference.

🎯 Goal of This Repository

My goal is to build a solid foundation in AWS and maintain a clean, organized knowledge base that I can use for:

1. Job interviews

2. DevOps project work

3. Real-world troubleshooting

4. AWS certifications
