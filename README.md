# AS-Fundamentals
Welcome to my AWS Fundamentals repository! This repo is my structured learning space where I document everything I learn about Amazon Web Services (AWS) — concepts, hands-on labs, best practices, and architecture notes.  Whether you're a beginner exploring AWS or preparing for certification, this repository aims to be a clear, practical reference.
